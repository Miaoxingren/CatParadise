            <p>Traditionally, historians tended to think ancient Egypt was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly.
            <br />
            The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat, rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the Fertile Crescent around the time of the development of agriculture and then they were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.</p>

            <p>First Cats: The prejudice against cats in our political process has long been overlooked. A great deal of attention is given to the “first dogs” who served in the White House, but very little press is said of our “first cats.” Cat lovers believe the answer to this mystery is simple: Dogs are publicity hounds, but cats prefer to work behind the scenes.
            <br />
            Cats influence our Presidents in ways that the Presidents don’t even notice (but the cats do). They have a long history in our nation’s capital, and have always done their jobs quietly and efficiently, never asking for more than their due. They began their careers as rat-catchers, which, in Washington, D.C., can be a full time job.</p>

            <p>Pleasure purring: In general purring has been associated as an expression of pleasure, or also as a form of communication with their young. Often a contented cat will purr on an owner's lap, and usually that means you have a happy cat at the moment! Often a contented cat will purr on an owner's lap, and usually that means you have a happy cat at the moment!
            <br />
            Self-healing purrs: Something puzzling is that cats also sometimes purr under stress or when recovering from an injury. Scientists are beginning to find that this is because purring seems to actually improve their healing process! Various studies showed an improvement in bone density during purring and it also seemed to promote overall healing.</p>
